# Deep-learning-for-Earthquake-Magnitude-and-Depth-Prediction-
The project aims to predict earthquake magnitudes and depths using deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks and LSTM models.

Research Question: How do different neural networks and LSTM models perform in predicting earthquake magnitudes and depths considering input variables such as Latitude, Longitude, Depth and Magnitude?
